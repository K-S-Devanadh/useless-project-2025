### 📝 Project Description
A digital-only fan that gets faster every time you click it. That’s it. It spins faster. The future is now.

---

### ❓ The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if your fan doesn’t listen to your feelings? What if you just want to keep clicking until something happens?

---

### 💡 The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made a web fan that spins faster every time you click. It even overheats (visually). The satisfaction is immeasurable.
