### 💡 Project Description  
A chaotic password generator game that keeps adding absurd requirements every second. You must type your password while following all the rules — even the ones that haven't appeared yet.

---

### ❓ The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Creating passwords is too easy and boring. We believe users should suffer just a little bit more to prove they’re worthy of logging in.

---

### 💥 The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
An ever-evolving password challenge where every second adds a new silly constraint — like including a fruit, a prime number, an emoji, or your birth month in Morse code. You fail if you break even one. You're welcome.
